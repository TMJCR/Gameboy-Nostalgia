A nostalgic Pokemon game in the style of the original Gameboy version:
Live Demo: https://gameboy-classic.herokuapp.com/

The game consists of two modes:

- An open world stage:
  This makes use of HTML Canvas to animate a sprite on the screen.
  When the character enters the grass there is a chance that they will encounter an enemy Pokemon. 
  
- A battle mode :
This uses an open source Pokemon API for Pokemon information and statistics.
A dynamic damage system has been developed which uses different characteristics to calculate damage based on the type of attack, the Pokemon type and the corresponding attack and defence attributes of both the attacking and defending Pokemon. These are based on calculations used in the original game to offer a closer playing experience to the original.
